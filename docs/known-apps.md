When an RHMI app authenticates to the car, its certificate describes the allowed resources that the app can send to the car by containing a list of SHA256 checksums. As custom apps are developed, they must use these existing certificates and their associated resources. This page is an inventory of known apps to help developers select the resources to use for their own apps.

Not only do different apps have specific icon packs and labels, but different UI Descriptions provide different features, which may be an important consideration for certain custom apps.

### 3rd Party Android Basecore Descriptions

BMW Connected for Android included official support for hosting 3rd party applications, using a custom [CarAPI Protocol]({% link carapi.md %}). BMW Connected included a set of common UI Descriptions and the app would pick one to use, and then provide its specific icons and texts resources. These descriptions contain a wide variety of states and are very flexible in arrangement, and most actions use a `<combinedAction>` to allow the app to dynamically set a destination state.

### 3rd Party iOS Apps

iOS apps use a different certificate authentication scheme, [documented here]({% link authentication.md %}). These are the 3rd party iOS apps I've found that still have the BMW resources in their IPA bundles, perhaps others might be found in archives.
